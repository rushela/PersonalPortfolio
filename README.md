# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It features a clean, single‚Äêpage layout with the following sections:

- **Hero**: Intro banner with name, tagline and links to GitHub/CV  
- **About**: Profile summary and strengths cards  
- **Skills**: Animated lists of languages, frameworks & tools  
- **Projects**: Showcase of academic and personal projects with thumbnails and links  
- **Timeline**: Vertical timeline of education & experience  
- **Contact**: Formspree-integrated contact form for direct email submissions  
- **Footer**: Social links & copyright  

All static assets (profile image, project screenshots, CV PDF) live in `public/assets`. Linting is configured via ESLint & Prettier, and the site is ready to deploy on Vercel or Netlify.
